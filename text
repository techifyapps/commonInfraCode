# Proposal: Secure WhatsApp Banking for **Bank of Montreal (BMO)**

**Extending BMO Digital Banking into Conversational Channels**

---

## 1. Executive Context (BMO Lens)

BMO is already strong in:

* Digital banking adoption
* AI-driven customer insights
* Omnichannel customer experience
* Strong governance under OSFI & PIPEDA

The next logical evolution is **controlled conversational banking**, where **WhatsApp becomes a secure engagement layer**, not a banking system.

This proposal positions WhatsApp Banking as:

* **An extension of BMO Mobile & Online Banking**
* **A cost-optimization lever for contact centers**
* **A customer-experience differentiator**, especially for retail, newcomers, and SMEs

---

## 2. Why WhatsApp Makes Sense *for BMO*

### BMO-Specific Customer Segments

* Newcomers to Canada
* Small & Medium Businesses
* Cross-border customers (US–Canada)
* Retail customers preferring messaging over calls

These segments already **trust WhatsApp** more than email or IVR.

---

## 3. Clear Positioning (Important for Risk Teams)

> WhatsApp is **only a channel**
> BMO remains the **sole authority** for authentication, authorization, and data access

No data is stored or processed inside WhatsApp systems.

---

## 4. Use Cases Aligned to BMO Risk Appetite (Phase 1)

**Read-only, high-volume, low-risk journeys**

| Category | BMO Examples                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Accounts | Balance, last 5 transactions      |
| Cards    | Credit card due date, minimum due |
| Loans    | Mortgage / personal loan EMI info |
| Alerts   | “Did my payroll credit?”          |
| Support  | Case status, FAQs                 |
| Guidance | Decline reasons, next steps       |

🚫 No beneficiary changes
🚫 No profile edits

## 5. BMO-Ready Architecture

```
Customer (WhatsApp)
   ↓
WhatsApp Business API
   ↓
BMO API Gateway + WAF
   ↓
Identity & Access (IAM)
   ↓
BMO AI Banking Agent
   ↓
Core Banking / Cards / CRM
```

### Key Design Principle

AI **never talks directly to core systems**
All access goes through **existing BMO APIs & controls**

---

## 6. Authentication & Identity (Critical for BMO)

### Step 1: WhatsApp Number Binding (One-Time)

* Customer starts WhatsApp Banking
* Receives **secure deep link**
* Logs in via:

  * BMO Mobile App **or**
  * BMO Online Banking
* WhatsApp number is:

  * Verified
  * Tokenized
  * Bound to customer profile

✔ Fully auditable
✔ Revocable anytime
✔ No credentials stored

---

### Step 2: Risk-Based Session Authentication

| Query Type     | Authentication            |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Balance        | Short-lived session token |
| Transactions   | OTP / push notification   |
| Card block     | App confirmation          |
| Sensitive info | Full re-auth              |

Sessions expire automatically (5–10 mins).

---

### Step 3: Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

* OTP (SMS / App)
* Push approval via BMO Mobile
* Device & behavioral checks
* Velocity & anomaly detection

**WhatsApp never authenticates the customer — BMO always does**

---

## 7. AI Agent Design (BMO-Controlled)

### What the AI Agent Does

* Interprets intent
* Validates permissions
* Calls **approved BMO APIs**
* Masks sensitive data
* Generates compliant responses

### What the AI Agent Is NOT Allowed To Do

❌ No database access
❌ No credential handling
❌ No autonomous decisions
❌ No data storage

AI = **Orchestration + Intelligence**, not authority

---

## 8. Security & Compliance (Mapped to BMO Standards)

### Data Security

* Zero PII stored in WhatsApp
* Tokenized session references
* End-to-end encrypted channel
* Encrypted in transit & at rest (bank side)

### Regulatory Alignment

* OSFI B-10 (Third-Party Risk)
* PIPEDA
* PCI DSS
* SOC 2
* Full audit & traceability

### Fraud Controls

* Geo-fencing
* Device fingerprinting
* Rate limits
* Fraud engine integration
* Kill switch (immediate disable)

---

## 9. Operating Model (BMO Practicality)

### Contact Center Integration

* AI handles Tier-1
* Seamless escalation to live agent
* Conversation history preserved
* Reduced average handle time (AHT)

### Analytics

* Cost-per-interaction reduction
* Deflection rate from call center
* CSAT improvement
* Intent trend analysis

---

## 10. Rollout Plan (Low Risk, High Control)

### Phase 1 – Internal & Pilot

* BMO employees
* Limited customer cohort
* Read-only journeys
* Security validation

### Phase 2 – Controlled Launch

* Retail + SME segments
* Support & card journeys
* Call center integration

### Phase 3 – Advanced Experiences

* Proactive alerts
* Personalized insights
* AI-assisted recommendations (non-selling first)

---

## 11. Why This Works for BMO

✔ Aligns with BMO’s digital-first strategy
✔ No new regulatory exposure
✔ No core system risk
✔ Clear ROI via call deflection
✔ Bank-controlled AI (not vendor-led)

---

## 12. Board-Level Soundbite (Use This)

> “This initiative does not change how BMO authenticates customers.
> It changes **where** customers interact with us — securely, compliantly, and on their preferred channel.”
